\section*{Abstract}
Secure multi-party computation (MPC) protocols often employ correlated randomness to enhance efficiency, taking advantage of a structure that divides their operations into two distinct phases: a computationally intensive, input-independent (offline) preprocessing phase, and a highly efficient, input-dependent (online) phase. In general, this approach is attractive because it allows the parties to use previously unused idle time for preprocessing in order to speed up the time-critical online part of their protocol. Some schemes take this a step further by designing their preprocessing phase to allow the online phase to be non-interactive. This makes these schemes very attractive for high-latency environments, such as when participants are geographically dispersed, since costly rounds of communication are eliminated Pseudorandom correlation generators (PCGs), introduced by Boyle et al. \cite{boyle2019efficient, boyle2020efficient}, facilitate this approach by extending short correlated seeds into long instances of a target correlation. In particular, the primitive allows seed generation with sublinear communication complexity, while the extension can be performed locally, making the preprocessing phase practical compared to previous approaches. Despite their theoretical value and use in various MPC protocols, PCG implementations have been lacking. 

This work addresses this by presenting practical considerations for implementing the PCG construction by Boyle et al. \cite{boyle2020efficient}. We demonstrate the value of these optimizations within the offline phase of Faust et al.'s non-interactive threshold BBS+ signature scheme \cite{faust2023non}. Our implementation is the first to support the threshold setting and achieves quasilinear runtime for the number of presignatures generated, with linear runtime increasing for the number of participants. We provide benchmarks for up to $10$ parties and find that in the $2$-out-of-$2$ setting, our PCG generates $2^{17}$ presignatures in $100$ms per presignature while adding around $80$ms per additional party. Our implementation significantly outperforms ($6$x to $10$x) the only other available PCG implementation for threshold ECDSA \cite{abram2022low} while incorporating an additional correlation.
