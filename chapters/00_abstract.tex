\section*{Abstract}
Secure multi-party computation (MPC) protocols often employ correlated randomness to improve efficiency and benefit from this by separating their operations into a computationally intensive preprocessing (offline) phase and a highly efficient, non-interactive (online) phase. This trade-off is especially valuable in setups with high latency, such as when participants are geographically dispersed. By making the online phase non-interactive, the otherwise costly rounds of communication are eliminated. In addition, it allows parties to utilize previously unused idle time for preprocessing in order to speed up the time-critical, input-dependent part of their protocol. Pseudorandom correlation generators (PCG), introduced by Boyle et al. \cite{boyle2019efficient, boyle2020efficient}, facilitate the preprocessing approach by extending short correlated seeds into long instances of a target correlation. In particular, the primitive allows seed generation with sublinear communication complexity, while the extension can be performed locally, making the preprocessing phase practical compared to previous approaches. Despite their theoretical value and use in various MPC protocols, PCG implementations have been lacking. 

This work addresses this by presenting practical considerations for implementing the PCG construction by Boyle et al. \cite{boyle2020efficient}. We demonstrate the value of these optimizations within the offline phase of Faust et al.'s non-interactive threshold BBS+ signature scheme \cite{faust2023non}. Our implementation is the first to support the threshold setting and achieves quasilinear runtime for the number of presignatures generated, with linear runtime increasing for the number of participants. We provide benchmarks for up to $10$ parties and find that in the $2$-out-of-$2$ setting, our PCG generates $2^{17}$ presignatures in $100$ms per presignature while adding around $80$ms per additional party. Our implementation significantly outperforms ($6$x to $10$x) the only other available PCG implementation for threshold ECDSA \cite{abram2022low} while incorporating an additional correlation.
